# Barabasi-Albert network model

Implementation and analysis of Barabasi-Albert network model, with 3 variations of attachment:

- pure preferential

- pure random

- existing vertices (mixed)


---
To run a set of simulations, use BA.py which saves in /output/ folder (run settings at top of file).

Then, use analyseBA.py for plotting degree distribution and other analysis (settings at top).

Both files should be in the same folder, along with logbin.py (credit: Max Falkenberg McGillivray).

Requirements: Standard scientific python libraries (numpy, scipy, pandas etc.), networkx, tqdm
